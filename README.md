# Time Series Outlier Detection

## Description
This project is based on the KDD Cup 2021. Time series data is composed of a sequence of values over time, which exists in many applications, such as stock prices and websites. However, some values may deviate so much from other normal observations, and these unnormal values are called anomalies. Anomalous data can indicate critical incidents, such as technical incidents. Anomaly detection on time series data is to identify these unnormal data points, where machine learning technique is progressively being utilized to detect anomalies automatically.
